# Personal Gentoo Overlay

This is my personal overlay, where I put Gentoo ebuilds that I make.

This includes:
- Software that I want to use but could not find a working ebuild for.
- Modified versions of ebuilds from other places, for whatever reason.
- My own personal software projects.

Basically, stuff I care about.

You are welcome to take my ebuilds from here and do absolutely anything
you want with them. After all, they are just some scripts for building stuff
with a particular distribution's tools.


## Adding with Layman

This overlay has now been added to layman's list of overlays.

You can now add it like any other overlay from there:

```
layman -a TAJJADA
```

## Documentation

See the `CONTENTS.md` file for various notes regarding each ebuild in the
overlay, including my reasons for creating it, important differences from
other similar ebuilds in other overlays/gentoo, and other information.
