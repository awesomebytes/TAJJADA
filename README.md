# Personal Gentoo Overlay

This is my personal overlay, where I put Gentoo ebuilds that I make.

This includes:
- Software that I want to use but could not find a working ebuild for.
- Modified versions of ebuilds from other places, for whatever reason.
- My own personal software projects.

Basically, stuff I care about.

You are welcome to take my ebuilds from here and do absolutely anything
you want with them. After all, they are just some scripts for building stuff
with a particular distribution's tools.


## Adding with Layman

This overlay has now been added to layman's list of overlays.

You can now add it like any other overlay from there:
