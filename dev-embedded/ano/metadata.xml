		Arturo/ano is a commandline tool for Arduino development, that allows one to use any text editor and a standard Makefile-based build system for writing Arduino programs, instead of the official Java-based GUI Arduino IDE.

		Arturo/ano is a fork of ino (which is now a discontinued / unmaintained project), which aims to continue its development, and is updated to support the latest official Arduino libraries and software.
