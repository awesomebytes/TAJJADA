		ino is a commandline tool for Arduino development, that allows one to use any text editor and a standard Makefile-based build system for writing Arduino programs, instead of the official Java-based GUI Arduino IDE.

		ino has been unmaintained for years, and does not support the latest official Arduino libraries and software. Please use Arturo/ano (a fork of ino to continue development) instead.
